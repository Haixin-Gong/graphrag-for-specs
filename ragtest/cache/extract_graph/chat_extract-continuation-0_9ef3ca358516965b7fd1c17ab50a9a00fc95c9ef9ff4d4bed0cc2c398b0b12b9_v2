室内墙体颜色、美观整齐相协调。对于大型配电设备，如落地式动\n力配电箱，暗装比较困难，为了减少积尘，宜放在非洁净区，如技术\n夹层或技术夹道等。\n9.1.6 管线暗敷原因见第 9.1. 5条的条文说明。\n考虑防火要求，管材应采用不燃材料。\n当净化空调系统停止运行，该系统又未设值班送风时，为防止\n由于压差而使尘粒通过管线空隙渗入洁净室，所以由非洁净区进\n入洁净区，不同级别洁净室之间电气管线口应做密封处理。\n9.2照明\n9.2.1 洁净室的照明一般要求照度高，但灯具安装的数量受到送\n风风口数量和位置等条件的限制，这就要求在达到同一照度值情\n况下，安装灯具的个数最少。荧光灯的发光效率一般是白炽灯的\n3倍~4倍，而且发热量小，有利于空调节能。此外，洁净室天然采\n光少，在选用光源时还需考虑它的光谱分布尽量接近于天然光，荧\n光灯基本能满足这一要求。因此，目前国内外洁净室一般均采用\n荧光灯作为照明光源。当有些洁净室层高较高，采用一般荧光灯\n照明很难达到设计照度值，在此情况下，可采用其他光色好、光\n效更高的光源。由于某些生产工艺对光源光色有特殊要求，或\n荧光灯对生产工艺和测试设备有干扰时，也可采用其他形式光\n源。\n9.2.2 照明灯具的安装方式是洁净室照明设计的重要课题之 u\n随着洁净技术的发展，普遍认为要保持洁净室内的洁净度关键有\n三个要素:\n(1)使用合适的高效过滤器。\n(2)解决好气流流型，维持室内外压差。\n(3)保持室内免受、污染。\n因此，能否保持洁净度主要取决于净化空调系统及选用的设\n备，当然也要消除工作人员及其他物体的尘源。众所周知，照明灯\n• 102 • 具并不是主要尘源，但如果安装不妥，将会通过灯具缝隙渗入尘\n粒。实践证明，灯具嵌入顶棚暗装，在施工中往往与建筑配合误差\n较大，造成密封不严，不能达到预期效果，而且技资大，发光效率\n低。实践和测试结果表明，在非单向流洁净室中，照明灯具明装并\n不会使洁净度等级有所下降。\n鉴于以上原因，在洁净室中灯具安装应以吸顶明装为好。但\n是若灯具安装受到层高限制及工艺特殊要求暗装时，一定要做好\n密封处理，以防尘粒渗入洁净室，灯具结构能便于清扫和更换\n灯管。\n据调查，目前国内已有包括带格栅的各种类型洁净室专用灯\n具生产，本条取消了相关灯具形式的限制性规定，并明确应采用洁\n净室专用灯具。洁净室的灯具及其\n######################\nOutput:",
