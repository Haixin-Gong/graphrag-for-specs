相互协调，使投资长期发挥\n作用。此外，温度或沉陷不但可能影响安全，而且还会破坏建筑装\n修的完整性及围护结构的气密性，故须对主体结构采取相应措施。\n5.1. 5 对兼有一般生产和洁净生产的综合性厂房，在考虑其平面\n布局和构造处理时，应合理组织人流、物流运输及消防疏散线路，\n避免一般生产对洁净生产带来不利的影响。当防火方面与洁净生\n产要求有冲突时，应采取措施，在确保消防疏散的前提下，减少对\n洁净生产的不利影响。\n5.2 防火和疏散\n5.2.1 洁净厂房虽不同于一般工业厂房，但在材料与构造的耐火\n性能以及火灾的火势形成、发展与扩散等基本特性方面，两者都基\n本一致。所以现行国家标准《建筑设计防火规范 ))GB50016中不\n少条文同样适用于洁净厂房。本节主要结合洁净厂房的下列特\n点，对于防火规范尚未包括或者不全适合的部分做必要的补充:\n• 69 • (1)空间密闭，火灾发生后，烟量特大，对于疏散和扑救极为不\n利。同时由于热量无处泄漏，火源的热辐射经四壁反射室内迅速\n升温，大大缩短了全室各部位材料达到燃点的时间。\n当厂房外墙无窗时，室内发生的火灾往往不容易被外界发现，\n发现后也不容易选定扑救突破口。\n(2)平面布置曲折，增加了疏散路线上的障碍，延长了安全疏\n散的距离和时间。\n(3)若干洁净室都通过风管彼此串通，当火灾发生，特别是火\n势初起未被发现而又继续送风的情况下，风管成为烟、火迅速外\n窜，殃及其余房间的重要通道。\n(4)室内装修使用了一些高分子合成材料，这些材料在燃烧时\n产生浓烟，散发毒气。有的燃烧速度极快。\n(5)某些生产过程使用易燃易爆物质，火灾危险性高。如甲\n醇、甲苯、丙酣、丁固、乙酸乙醋、乙醇、甲皖、二氯甲皖、硅饶、异丙\n醇、氢等都是甲、乙类易燃易爆物质，对洁净厂房构成潜在的火灾\n威胁。\n此外，洁净厂房内往往有不少极为精密、贵重的设备，建设投\n资十分昂贵，一旦失火，损失极大。\n鉴于以上几方面的特点，为了保障生命、财产的安全，尽量减\n少火灾中的损失，本规范分别从防止起火与延烧，便利疏散与抢救\n这两个方面补充提出若干条文，强调了建筑耐火等级与防火分隔，\n对于防火墙间占地面积与疏散路线提出较严格的要求。这部分规\n范编制工作在公安部有关部\n######################\nOutput:",
