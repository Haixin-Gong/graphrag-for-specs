MCZ-6000D型是用直拉法（切克劳斯基法）半自动生长单晶的炉型，主要用于硅单晶的生长。它是在惰性气体环境下通过石墨电阻加热器熔化硅原料，用减压方式，软轴提拉晶体。该设备主要用于大规模生产太阳能级硅单晶，在优化条件后，也可生产IC级单晶。\n　　　本设备结构可方便地配置水平、垂直及钩型磁场，实现等效微重力生长晶体，可配置18″或20″热系统，最大投料量90Kg，最大晶体直径10″。\n1.2 主要技术特征\n　　　主炉室和副炉室的提升和外旋采用机械结构，既免去了液压系统、减少油污染又利于配置磁场。\n　　　本设备主机上采用浮动式插板阀，降低了主机高度。\n　　　主机配置了完成全自动拉晶的全部接口，经电气柜升级可完成全自动拉晶。\n　　　主机设计特别有利于配置不同的磁场。\n　　　可实现多台设备的网络式计算机集中管理。\n　　　坩埚升降备有慢速、快速、手动三个功能，各传动链均通过电磁离合器直接驱动升降用丝杠\n######################\nOutput:",
