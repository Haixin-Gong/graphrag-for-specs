几乎是个常数，其值为数十伏(在以下的计算中取其值为30V)。\n考虑全部能量用于加热金属体，这样的计算偏于安全侧，可按下式计算：将表10的相关数值代入式(21)得，雷击每库仑(C)能熔化以下的金属体积：铝，V/Q≈\n11.6mm3/C；软钢，V/Q≈4mm3/C；铜，V/Q≈5.5mm3/C。\n在原西德慕尼黑联邦国防军大学的高压实验室，做过分析研究得出，对金属板穿孔起决定性\n作用的不是短时雷击电荷Qs(见本规范表F.0.1-1)，而是长时间雷击电荷Q1(见本规范表\nF.0.1-4)。其研究结果是：当Q1＝100C(第三类防雷建筑物的雷击参量)时，对1.5mm厚\n的钢板、黄铜板、铜板以及2mm厚的铝板，在各种情况下均穿孔，穿孔的直径约为4mm～\n8mm。当Q1＝200C(第一类防雷建筑物的雷击参量)时，对2mm厚的钢板、黄铜板、铜板以及2.5mm厚的铝板，在各种情况下均穿孔，穿孔的直径对钢板、黄铜板、铜板约为\n4mm～12mm，对铝板的穿孔直径约为7mm～13mm(对铝板，约有25％的情况，甚至\n3mm也熔化穿孔)。\n近年来，经常采用一种夹有非易燃物保温层的双金属板做成的屋面板(彩板)。在这种情况下，\n只要上层金属板的厚度满足本条第2款的要求就可以，因为雷击只会将上层金属板熔化穿\n孔，不会击到下层金属板，而且上层金属板的熔化物受到下层金属板的阻挡，不会滴落到下\n层金属板的下方。要强调的是，夹层的物质必须是非易燃物且选用高级别的阻燃类别。\n5.2.8除第一类防雷建筑物和本规范第4.3.2条第1款的规定外，屋顶上永久性金属物宜作\n为接闪器，但其各部件之间均应连成电气贯通，并应符合下列规定：\n1旗杆、栏杆、装饰物、女儿墙上的盖板等，其截面应符合本规范表5.2.1的规定，其壁厚\n应符合本规范第5.2.7条的规定。\n2输送和储存物体的钢管和钢罐的壁厚不应小于2.5mm；当钢管、钢罐一旦被雷击穿，其\n内的介质对周围环境造成危险时，其壁厚不应小于4mm。\n3利用屋顶建筑构件内钢筋作接闪器应符合本规范第4.3.5条和第4.4.5条的规定。\n5.2.9除利用混凝土构件钢筋或在混凝土内专设钢材作接闪器外，钢质接闪器应热镀锌。在\n腐蚀性较强的场所，尚应采取加大截面或其他防腐措施。\n▲收起条文说明\n5.2.9敷设在混凝土内的金属体，由于受到混凝土的保护，不需要采取防腐措施。\n######################\nOutput:",
