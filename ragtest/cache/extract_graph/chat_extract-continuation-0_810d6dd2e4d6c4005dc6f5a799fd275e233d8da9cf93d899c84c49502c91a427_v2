为了保证洁净室在正常工作或空气平衡暂时受到破坏时，\n气流都能从空气洁净度高的区域流向空气洁净度低的区域，使洁\n净室的洁净度不会受到污染空气的干扰，所以洁净室必须保持一\n定的压差。\n在国内外洁净室标准和洁净度等级中，对洁净室内压差值的\n大小都作了明确规定。\n压差值的大小应选择适当。压差值选择过小，洁净室的压差\n很容易破坏，洁净室的洁净度就会受到影响。压差值选择过大，就\n会使净化空调系统的新风量增大，空调负荷增加，同时使中效、高\n效过滤器使用寿命缩短，故很不经济。另外，当室内压差值高于\n50Pa时，门的开关就会受到影响。因此，洁净室压差值的大小应\n根据我国现有洁净室的建设经验，参照国内外有关标准和试验研\n• 76 • 究的结果合理确定。\n自《洁净厂房设计规范 ))GBJ 73-84 在1985年颁布以来，我\n国按规范设计、建造了数百万平方米的各种洁净级别的洁净室，并\n且都经过了数年的运行考验，满足了工艺要求。实践经验证明，\n《洁净厂房设计规范 ))GBJ 73-84中有关洁净室内正压值的选择\n是正确的、可行的。\n已颁布实施的国际标准《洁净室及相关受控环境一一第一部\n分，空气洁净度的分级))l SO14644-1 和日本工业标准《洁净室悬\n浮粒子检测方法))]l S9920、俄罗斯国家标准《洁净室及相关受控\n环境))T OCTP 50766等有关现行的洁净室标准中都明确规定，为\n了保持洁净室的洁净度等级免受外界的干扰，对于不同等级的洁\n净室之间、洁净室与相邻的无洁净度级别的房间之间都必须维持\n一定的压差。虽然各个国家规定的最小压差值不尽相同，但最小\n压差值都在 5Pa以上。\n由于洁净室(区)与周围空间维持一定的压差是实现空气洁净\n度的基本条件，为此，规定本条为强制性条文。\n6.2.2 试验研究的结果表明，洁净室内正压值受室外风速的影\n响，室内正压值要高于室外风速产生的风压力。当室外风速大于\n3m/s时，产生的风压力接近 5Pa，若洁净室内正压值为 5Pa时，室\n外的污染空气就有可能渗漏到室内。但根据现行国家标准《采暖\n通风和空气调节设计规范 ))GB50019编制组提供的全国气象资料\n统计，全国 203个城市中有 74个城市的冬夏平均风速大于 3m/s ，\n占总数的 36.4%。这样如果洁净室与室外相邻时，其最小的正压\n值应该大于 5Pa。因此，规定洁净室与室\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>洁净厂房设计规范 GBJ 73-84<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Chinese
