O.05μm的粒子，因此需要相应\n高质量的输送管道和阀门，但不同材质或同一材质管道内壁处理\n方法不同，价格相差甚远，如某工程拟引进 316L材质的不锈钢\n管，内壁电抛光处理要比未经处理的价格高出1. 6倍~2.1 倍。\n因此管道材料、内壁处理和阀门形式的选用要根据具体的生产工\n艺区别对待，这样才能做到既满足生产主艺要求，又经济合理。\n8.2.2 根据对国内洁净厂房使用情况的调查，大多数工厂高纯气\n体管道是采用不锈钢管，因为它具有化学稳定性好，渗透性小，吸\n附性差等特性，输送的气体质量能满足生产工艺的要求。\n阀门的严密性好坏是影响气体纯度的重要因素之一。国内多\n数洁净厂房和某些引进或合资项目的高纯气体管道阀门基本上都\n是采用不锈钢材质，阀门类型有隔膜阀、波纹管阀和球阀。波纹管\n阀比球阀严密性好，隔膜阀除严密性好外，还具有阀体死体积小、\n易吹除的特点，因此适用于气体纯度要求极高，生产工艺严格或危\n险性大的气体。\n• 95 • 如上海某集成电路厂前工序 (0.35μm) 技术，芯片直径 8\"，要\n求高纯气体中杂质含量均要小于 10XlO-9，氮、氢、氧、氧气体管\n道采用进口 SS316L 内壁电抛光处理(通称 EP管)0316L是低碳\n不锈钢管，其使用原因是防止钢材中碳组分的析出及吸附或释放\n杂质气体，影响气体纯度并导致产品成品率下降。阔门是隔膜阀\nCajon VCR密封连接形式。又如深圳某公司集成电路后工序，气\n体纯度要求 99.999% 、露点一 700C，氮气、氮氢混合气、氧气管道\n均采用 SS304不锈钢管，国内合资企业进行内壁光亮抛光处理，\n阀门为进口球阀，Xl(卡套连接。\n为此，本条规定按生产主艺和对气体纯度的要求选用合适的\n不锈钢管材和阀门。\n8.2.3 本条规定干燥压缩空气露点低于一 700C时，应采用不锈钢\n管内壁经抛光处理，并非规定要进行电抛光。而是可以采用机械\n抛光。化学抛光俗称光亮抛光，因为表面光亮水分不易被吸附、滞\n留在管道表面，而且极易被吹除干燥，对输送低露点的气体是十分\n必要的。 SS304钢相当于国内钢牌号为 OCrl8Ni9 。如上海某工\n程集成电路厂干燥压缩空气露点要求一 730C，采用管材为 SS304\n钢，内壁光亮抛光(通称
