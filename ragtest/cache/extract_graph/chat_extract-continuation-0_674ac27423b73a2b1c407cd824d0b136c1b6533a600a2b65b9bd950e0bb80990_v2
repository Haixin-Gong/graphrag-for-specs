。由此可见，\n只要对风道系统采取消声和防止管道固体传声等措施，洁净室噪\n声可以大幅度降低。\n国内还有不少洁净室，由于系统设计合理，并采取了降噪措\n施，室内噪声得到有效控制。\n排风系统噪声对洁净室影响极大，以集成电路生产为例，在生\n产过程中，外延、扩散、腐蚀、清洗等多种工序都需设排风系统。近\n年来，洁净厂房排风系统的噪声治理日益受到重视，要注意选用低\n噪声风机等。\n由于洁净室内的工作环境要求比较安静，洁净室的密封性能\n较好，噪声不易衰减。按规定限制风管风速，既减小了净化空调系\n统的阻力，降低了风机压头和转速，减弱了风机的噪声，又防止了\n风速过大而产生附加噪声。\n如上所述，第 4.4.3条~第 4.4.6条的规定均为洁净厂房设计\n中，从平面和空间设计到各类设备、系统及其附属设备等的选择都应\n充分考虑噪声控制措施，以确保达到洁净厂房要求的噪声控制值。原\n规范中将第 4.4.3条、第 4.4.4条规定为强制性条文，但在实施中各单\n位认为规定过严，可操作性也不强，为此本次修订改为推荐性条文。\n4.5微振控制\n4.5.1 有微振控制要求的洁净厂房，设计应考虑建筑结构的选型\n及地面(楼面)的构造做法，如增加基础及上部结构垂直及横向刚\n度，增加地面(楼面)刚度，能有效减小振动影响。此外，还应考虑隔\n振缝设置及其有效的构造措施，壁板与地面及顶棚采用柔性连接等，\n均能减小振动传递。即减小了对精密设备、仪器仪表的振动影响。\n在洁净厂房设计中，应首先考虑对强振摞采取隔振措施，以减\n小强振源对精密设备、仪器仪表的振动影响，在此基础上，精密设\n备、仪器仪表再根据各自的容许振动值采取被动隔振措施，就大致\n能够达到预定目的。\n• 67 • 在原规范中，本条为强制性条文，虽然明确规定本条只用于有\n微振控制要求的洁净厂房，但由于没有量化的规定，容易引起执行\n不准确的问题，实施以来确有此种情况发生，为此本次修订将本条\n改为推荐性条文。\n4.5.4 精密设备、仪器仪表的被动隔振措施，由隔振台座及隔振\n器(或隔振装置)组成。根据隔振设计计算需要，设定隔振台座为\n不变形刚体，为此应对隔振台座的形状、几何尺寸及材质选用等方\n面加以考虑，使之具有足够的刚度。\n某些精密设备、仪器仪表在运行时，由于移动部件位置变化或\n加工、测试件的质量及质\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
