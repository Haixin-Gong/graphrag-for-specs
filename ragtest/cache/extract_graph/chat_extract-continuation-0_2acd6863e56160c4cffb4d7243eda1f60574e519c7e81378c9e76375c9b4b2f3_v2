DL/T53940 \n4.3.4 焊接不良不仅会带来安全隐患，而且会加速接地网接头部\n位的腐蚀，因此对接地线、接地极搭接焊的搭接长度作出要求，以\n保证焊接良好。\n4.3.5 针对服役工况对放热焊接接头的质量做了具体规定。\n4. 3. 6 铜或铜覆钢等金属绞线用压接端子与接地极连接，目的是\n保证电接接触良好。\n4.3.8 本条对电缆桥架的接地作了规定，目的是保证接地导通性\n• 43

GIS重要设备（接地开关、金属氧化物避雷器）接地良好，\nGIS接地母线与主接地装置良好以及电气接触良好。当盆式绝缘\n子外圈有金属层可保证与法兰良好的接地导通时，法兰片间可不\n用跨接线连接。\n4. 3.11 对本条说明如下：\n1 本款引自现行国家标准《旋转电机定额和性能》 GB755 \n2008的第 11.1条，为了保证电机接地故障时保护接地线有足够\n的容量。\n2 本款引自现行国家标准《中小型旋转电机通用安全要求》\nGB 14711 2013的第 9.5条，为规定接地螺栓应专用，如接地线\n接在风罩、吊环、地脚螺栓或其他紧固螺栓上不可靠。\n4.4 接地装置的降阻\n4. 4.1 本条提出了在高土壤电阻率地区降低接地电阻的基本方\n法。实践中应注意，各种降阻方法都有其应用的特定条件，在使用\n过程中也宜相互配合，以获得明显的降阻效果。考虑到垂直接地\n极间的屏蔽作用，深井施工时部分深井可打成斜井。\n4.4.3
