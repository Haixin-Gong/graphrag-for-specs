，其他一些洁净室的生产环境的噪\n声也偏高，也就是说，从噪声的效应来看，标准低于 65dB(均为好。\n• 65 • 对国内几个行业不同气流流型洁净室的静态和动态噪声所进\n行的分析表明，不同气流流型的静态噪声有较大差异。非单向流\n清净室的静态噪声实测值在 41dB(A) ~64dB(A)范围内，平均为\n54dB(A) ;单向流、混合流洁净室的静态噪声实测值在 51dB(A)~\n75dB(A)范围内，平均为 65dB(A) 。非单向流洁净室比单向流洁\n净室的静态噪声平均值约低 lldB(A) 。\n由于噪声控制要求是确保人员健康的重要条件，本条为强制\n性条文。\n4.4.3-4.4.6 控制设备噪声首先要从声源上考虑，设计时应选\n用低噪声设备。在某些情况下，由于技术或经济上的原因而难以\n做到时，则应从噪声传播途径上采取降噪措施，如把高噪声工艺设\n备迁出洁净室或隔离布置于隔声间内。有些由于与生产联系密\n切，必须置于洁净区内的高噪声设备，亦可采用隔声罩隔绝噪声。\n国内现有洁净厂房中，不少洁净室将机械泵一类高噪声设备\n置于洁净室外套间或技术夹道内，洁净室内噪声有明显降低。\n洁净室的静态噪声主要来源于净化空调系统和局部净化设备\n运行噪声，静态噪声的大小与洁净室气流流型、换气次数等因素有\n关。但关键在于净化空调系统的布置及合理的降噪措施，不合理\n的设计方案必然导致较高的静态噪声。\n关于降低洁净室净化空调系统噪声的措施，国内外有关资料\n提出了一些有效的措施:\n如《现代洁净室概念》一文中强调\"选择那种能满足气流要求\n的噪声最低的风机，还应该采用弹性减振基础\"。关于消声器的使\n用，文中说\"管道消声器在中频和高频范围内降低噪声是有效的，\n当风管敷设长度在 50ft以内时，就应考虑采用消声器\"。关于风\n管的连接，文中又说\"通风机和送风管道与回风管道之间，应采用\n柔性连接管隔开\"。还要求\"将通风机外亮、静压箱和管道等加上\n衬里\"。如北京某大学微电子研究所回风管道在未处理前噪声高\n达83.5dB(A) ，经过加设衬垫处理后噪声降到 66.2dB(A) ，使光\n• 66 • 刻间的室内环境噪声平均下降了 7dB(A) ~9dB(A) 。由此可见，\n只要对风道系统采取消声和防止管道固体传声等措施，洁净室噪\n声可以大幅度降低。\n国内还有不少洁净室，由于系统设计合理，并\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>上海某公司<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A
