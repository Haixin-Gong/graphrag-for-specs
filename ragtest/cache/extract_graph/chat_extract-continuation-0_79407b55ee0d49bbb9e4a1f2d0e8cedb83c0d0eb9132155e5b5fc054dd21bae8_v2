在满足所要求的表面积前提\n下，选用多根或一根圆钢。\n3)圆钢直径选用8mm、10mm、12mm三种规格，选用大于Φ12mm的圆钢，一是浪费\n材料，二是施工时不易于弯曲。\n4)混凝土电阻率取100Ωm，这样，混凝土内钢筋体有效长度为\n ＝20m，即从引下线连\n接点开始，散流作用按各方向20m考虑。\n5)周长≥60m，按60m考虑，设三根引下线，此时，\n ＝0.44，另外还有56％的雷电流从\n另两根引下线流走，每根引下线各占28％。\n设这28％从两个方向流走，每一方向流走14％。因此，与第一根引下线连接的40m长接\n地体(一个方向20m，两个方向共计40m)，共计流走总电流的72％(0.44+0.14+0.14＝\n0.72)，即本条第4款所规定的4.24\n2和本章第4.4.5条第1款所规定的1.89\n2中的\n等于0.72。\n6)40m～60m周长时按40m长考虑，\n 等于1，即按40m长流走全部雷电流考虑。\n7)小于40m周长时无法预先定出规格和尺寸，只能按是\n 等于1由设计者根据具体长度计\n算，并按以上原则选用。\n根据以上原则所计算的结果列于表8。整栋建筑物的槽形、板形、块形基础的钢筋表面积总是能满足钢筋表面积的要求。\n6混凝土内的钢筋借绑扎作为电气连接，当雷电流通过时，在连接处是否可能由此而发生\n混凝土的爆炸性炸裂，为了澄清这一问题，瑞士高压问题研究委员会进行过研究，认为钢筋\n之间的普通金属绑丝连接对防雷保护来说是完全足够的，而且确证，在任何情况下，在这样\n连接附近的混凝土决不会碎裂，甚至出现雷电流本身把绑在一起的钢筋焊接起来，如点焊一\n样，通过电流以后，一个这样的连接点的电阻下降为几个毫欧的数值。\n本条第6款为强制性条款。\n4.3.6共用接地装置的接地电阻应按50Hz电气装置的接地电阻确定，不应大于按人身安全\n所确定的接地电阻值。在土壤电阻率小于或等于3000Ωm时，外部防雷装置的接地体符合\n下列规定之一以及环形接地体所包围面积的等效圆半径等于或大于所规定的值时，可不计及\n冲击接地电阻；但当每根专设引下线的冲击接地电阻不大于10Ω时，可不按本条第1、2款\n敷设接地体：1当土壤电阻率\n 小于或等于800Ωm时，对环形接地体所包围面积的等效圆半径小于5m\n的情况，每一引下线处应补加水平接地体或垂直接地体。当补加水平接地体时，其最小长度\n应按本规范式(4.2.4-1)计算；当补加垂直接地体时，其最小长度应按本规范式(4.2.4-2)计算。\n2当土壤电阻率大于800Ωm、小于或等于3000Ωm，且对环形接地体所包围的面积的等\n效圆半径小于按下式的计算值时，每一引下线处应补加水平接地体或垂直接地\n######################\nOutput:",
