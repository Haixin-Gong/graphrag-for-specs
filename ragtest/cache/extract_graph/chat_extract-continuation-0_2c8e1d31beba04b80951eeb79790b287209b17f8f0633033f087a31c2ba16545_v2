�雷装置直接安装在建筑物上，要保持防雷装置与各种金属物\n体之间的间隔距离，通常这一间隔距离在运行中很难保证不会改变，即间隔距离减小了。因\n此，对于第一类防雷建筑物，应将屋内各种金属物体及进出建筑物的各种金属管线进行严格\n的等电位连接和接地，而且所有接地装置都必须共用或直接互相连接起来，使防雷装置与邻\n近的金属物体之间电位相等或降低其间的电位差，防止发生火花放电。\n一般来说，接地电阻越低，防雷得到的改善越多。但是，不能由于要达到某一很低的接地电\n阻而花费过大。出现火花放电危险可从基本计算公式U＝IR+l(di/dt)来评价，IR项对于建\n筑物内某一小范围中互相连接在一起的金属物(包括防雷装置)来说都是一样的，它们之间的\n电位差与防雷装置的接地电阻无关。此外，考虑到已采取严格的各种金属物与防雷装置之间的连接和均压措施，故不必要求很低的接地电阻。\n现在IEC的有关标准和美国的国家标准都规定，一栋建筑物的所有接地体应直接等电位连接\n在一起。\n6为了将雷电流散入大地而不会产生危险的过电压，接地装置的布置和尺寸比接地装置的\n特定值更重要。然而，通常建议采用低的接地电阻。本款的规定完全采用IEC62305—\n3:2010第26页5.4.2.2的规定(接地体的B型布置)。\n下面的图2系根据该规定的相应图换成本规范的防雷建筑物类别的图。该规定对接地体B\n型布置的规定是：对于环形接地体(或基础接地体)，其所包围的面积的平均几何半径r不应\n小于l1,即r≥l1，l1示于图2；当l1大于r时，则必须增加附加的水平放射形或垂直(或斜\n形)导体，其长度lr(水平)为lr＝l1－r或其长度lv(垂直)为\n 。由于接地体通常靠近墙、基础敷设，所以补加的水平接地体一般都是从引下线与环形接地体\n的连接点向外延伸，可为一根，也可为多根。\n由于本条采用了若干等电位措施，本款的接地电阻值不是起主要作用，因此，没有提出接地\n电阻值的具体要求。\n本款所要求的环形接地体的工频接地电阻R，在其半径r等于l1的场合下，当ρ＝500Ωm～\n30000Ωm时，大约处于13Ω～33Ω；当ρ小于500Ωm时，R＝0.067ρ(Ω)。\n环形接地体的工频接地电阻的计算式为R＝2ρ/3d(Ω)，d=\n 。其中ρ为土壤电\n阻率(Ωm)，A为环形接地体所包围的面积(m2)。当ρ＝500Ωm、d＝1Om时，R＝2×\n500/(3X10)＝33(Ω)。当ρ＝500Ωm～30000Ωm时，R＝（2×3000×380）/[3×2×（11×3000－3600）]=（3000\n×380）/（3×29400）=12.9≈13(Ω)。\n10关于本款的注，说明如下(以下有的资料摘自IEEEStd1100—2005：IEEE\nRecommendedpracticeforpoweringandgroundinge\n######################\nOutput:",
