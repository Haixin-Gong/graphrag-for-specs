在输送过程中应尽量减少需染，使停止使用时的物\n料残留尽量少，并使管道系统易于吹除，因此各类工业管道系统应\n尽量短，避免\"盲管\"等不易吹除的死角。\n由于各类工业管道在投入使用前或检修前、后均应进行吹除、\n排放达到预期洁净度或纯度要求，为此各工业管道系统应设必需\n的吹除口、放净口，以确保各系统的安全、稳定运行。为进行物料\n的化验、分析或吹除效果的取样，相应的管道系统还应设置取\n样口。\n鉴于各类工业管道输送的物料品种较多、纯度不同，不能做统\n一的强制性规定，为此将本条改为推荐性条文。\n8.1.4 本条规定工业管道穿过洁净室墙壁或楼板处的管段不应\n有焊缝，是便于检查焊缝的焊接质量。为保持洁净室的空气洁净\n度和室内正压规定，管道与墙壁或楼板之间应采取可靠的密封措\n施，密封材料常用硅橡胶等填堵。\n8.1. 5 可燃气体(包括城镇燃气、天然气、氢气等〉和氧气管道系\n统发生事故或气体纯度不符合要求时，需吹除置换，这些气体吹除\n置换时不能排入室内，所以在管道末端或最高点应设放散管，以便\n将气体排入大气。放散管的排放口应高出屋脊 1m.以防止由于风\n向的影响使排放的气体倒灌回室内。本条涉及可燃气体等管道系\n统的运行安全，为此作为强制性条文规定。\n8.1.6 对气体纯度要求严格的生产工艺，如电子工业中电真空器\n件、半导体器件、特种半导体器件、集成电路等生产工艺，从材料制\n备到器件制造、封装、性能测试等工艺过程中各种高纯气中的杂质\n含量将直接影响产品的合格率，如氢气用于硅外延时，在高温下氢\n中的微量氧和水汽易与硅作用生成二氧化硅而影响完整结晶生\n• 93 • 长，致使外延片的堆垛层错密度高，甚至变成多晶。\n氮气在扩散过程中作为运载气时，如果含有氧和水汽易使硅\n片表面氧化。故对净化装置的设置应根据气掘和生产工艺对气体\n纯度的要求，选择相应的气体净化装置。\n为保证使用点气体纯度符合要求，规定气体终端净化装置宜\n设在邻近用气点处以缩短高纯气体管道的长度，避免污染，气体终\n端净化装置应该是距离用气点越近越好，但往往受各种条件限制，\n难以实现，为此条文规定采用\"宜\"。\n8.1. 7 在各种生产工艺过程中不仅对各种气体纯度要求十分严\n格，而且对气体中含尘量也有相应严格的要求，有关专家指出，高\n纯气体中含尘量比其纯度在一定意义上显得更为重要，因此规定\n了根据不同的生产工艺要求设置相应精度的气体终端过滤器，并\n规定应设在靠近用气\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
