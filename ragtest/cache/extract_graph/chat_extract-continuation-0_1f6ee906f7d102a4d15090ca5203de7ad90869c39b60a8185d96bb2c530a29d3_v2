SS304\n钢，内壁光亮抛光(通称 BA管)，阔门采用波纹管阀双卡套连接;\n深圳某公司集成电路后工序干燥压缩空气露点要求一 700C，采用\n国内合资企业进行电抛光处理，阀门为进口球间，双卡套连接。\n对于干燥压缩空气露点低于- 400C，可以采用。 Cr18Ni9 不\n锈钢管 (304)或热镀铮无缝钢管，这在国内巳有多年运行经验，证\n明是可以满足此类压缩空气的输送要求的。\n8.3管道连接\n8.3. 1 工业管道的连接目前基本均采用焊接，主要是能确保管道\n连接的严密性。镀铸钢管一般是螺纹连接，由于施工较麻烦且严\n密性比焊接要难以保证，有少数单位采用焊接，它带来的问题是破\n坏了管道原有的镀铮层，容易生锈，焊接时出现有刺激性的异味对\n• 96 • 人体有害，而且管道内壁有脱落的镀层给吹扫带来困难并污染气\n体，为此本条规定镀铮钢管采用螺纹连接。\n不锈钢管承插焊连接的好处是便于管道对中，方便焊接，缺点\n是由于管道与承插件之间有间隙，产生死角，吹扫时不易吹除干\n净。对高纯气体要求高和严格的生产主艺会影响其产品质量，为\n此规定采用对接焊并要求内壁无焊缝，它是氢弧焊接时不施加不\n锈钢焊丝，利用焊件本身溶化填满焊缝。\n8.3.2 以往有些单位采用非金属软管两端加卡箍固定，优点是软\n管连接管道柔软，长度随意，连接方便，但由于非金属管道对气体\n和水的渗透性和吸附性都比金属管道差，而且易老化变形，极易造\n成气体渗漏影响气体质量。现在金属软管品种多、规格全、连接方\n式多样、使用寿命长，尤其对高纯气体不造成污染，虽价格较贵，但\n综合比较是合适的，为此本次修订时推荐宜采用金属软管。\n不同材料的管道对气体和水的渗透、吸附能力见表 10。\n表10不同管道材料渗透性、吸附性比较\n管道材料 渗透性 吸附性\n不锈钢 无 弱\n紫铜 元 对水吸附性强\n聚四氟乙烯 很小 ~~ \n真空橡胶 较小 强\n乳胶 大 强\n8.3.3 本条规定高纯气体管道与阀门连接的密封材料采用金属\n垫或双卡套，具体选择要随产品生产工艺对高纯气体质量的要求\n和本身特性决定。金属垫这种密封形式(国外称 Cajon VCR形\n式)严密性好、气体不渗漏和污染，通常用于高纯氢气或氮氢混合\n气系统以及要求气体杂质十分严格的生产\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>上海某工程集成电路厂<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A factory in
