这两条都是为了保证工艺所要求水质的措施。\n随着生产工艺对纯水水质的不断提高，甚至到了理论纯水的\n程度，尤其是集成电路的发展不但对水中电解质的含量要求极其\n严格，而且对细菌、微粒、有机物及榕解氧等都有极其严格的要求;\n医药工业中要求供应的注射用水，对水中含菌量、热源均有严格要\n求。除了严格的纯水制造过程外，纯水输送管道的管材选择和管\n网设计是保证使用点水质的关键。\n实践证明，采用循环供水方式是行之有效的。主要是基于保\n证输水管道内的流速和尽量减少不循环段的死水区，以减少纯水\n在管道内的停留时间，减少管道材料微量溶出物(即使目前质量最\n好的管道也会有微量物质溶出)对超纯水水质的影响，同时，基于\n流水不腐的道理，高的流速也可以防止细菌微生物的滋生。\n条文中有关要求及数据系根据国内外有关资料并结合近年设\n计、运行经验提出的。\n在纯水管材选择方面，主要应考虑三方面的因素:\n(1)材料的化学稳定性:纯水是一种极好的榕剂，为了保证在\n输送过程中纯水水质下降最小，必须选择化学稳定性极好的管材，\n也就是在所要求的纯水中的溶出物最小。溶出物的多少应由材料\n• 87 • 的溶出试验确定，其中包括金属离子、有机物的溶出。\n(2)管道内壁的光洁度 z若管道内壁有微小的凹凸，会造成微\n糙的沉积和微生物的繁殖，导致微粒和细菌两项指标的不合格。\n目前PVDF管道内壁粗糙度可达小于 1μm，而不锈钢管约为几十\n微米。\n(3)管道及管件接头处的平整度 z对于防止产生流水的涡流区\n是非常重要的。\n本规范适用于各类洁净厂房的设计，而各类产品生产工艺对\n纯水水质的要求差异较大，其纯水管材的选择主要是与水质相关，\n同时还应价廉、方便施工，为适应各类产品发展的需要和选择的灵\n活性，本次将纯水管道管材的选择修改为\"应符合生产工艺对水质\n要求，可选择不锈钢管或工程塑料管\"，而不列出具体的工程塑料\n管的品种。\n由于第 7.2.2条对纯水系统设计作出的规定都是为了确保输\n送到达用户设备的纯水水质，以满足各类产品生产的需要，这些措\n施的规定均只涉及产品质量和成品率等，为此本次修改为推荐性\n条文。\n7.2.4 定期清搅是保证管道内水质的重要手段，主要是防止长期\n运行后，内壁产生沉积物及微生物积聚使水质下降。\n7.3排水\n7~ 3.1 本条是对洁净厂房排水系统的原则性规定，没有涉及具体\n限值或界限等方面的规定，实施表明可改为推荐性条文。\n7.3.2 、7.3.3 洁净室内重\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PVDF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PVDF
