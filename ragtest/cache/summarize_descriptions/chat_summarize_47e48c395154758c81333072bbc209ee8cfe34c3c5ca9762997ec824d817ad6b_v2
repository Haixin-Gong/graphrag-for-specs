It functions by diverting excess current to a grounding device, thereby preventing insulation breakdown and damage to electrical equipment. SPDs are commonly installed in power distribution systems as part of lightning protection systems to ensure system integrity and safeguard sensitive devices.  \n\nIn some contexts, SPD may also refer to an organization or entity responsible for specifying installation requirements and standards for surge protection. However, the primary and most widely recognized meaning of SPD is the **Surge Protective Device**, which serves as a key element in mitigating the effects of lightning-induced electromagnetic pulses (电涌保护器用于防雷击电磁脉冲保护) and other electrical disturbances.  \n\nOverall, the SPD plays a vital role in maintaining the stability and safety of electrical systems by limiting transient overvoltages and redirecting surge currents away from critical equipment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404834, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 520, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 257}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
