Such environments are classified into zones 0, 1, and 2 based on the frequency and duration of the occurrence of these explosive gas mixtures. These classifications help determine the necessary safety measures and precautions required to mitigate the risk of explosions.  \n\nDue to the inherent danger, specific safety measures must be implemented, including specialized cable installation methods and other protective practices, to prevent ignition sources from triggering an explosion. The presence of explosive gases may vary depending on conditions, making continuous monitoring and adherence to safety standards critical in these environments.  \n\nOverall, an explosive gas environment demands strict regulatory compliance, proper equipment selection, and operational protocols to ensure safety and prevent catastrophic incidents.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404836, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 204}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
