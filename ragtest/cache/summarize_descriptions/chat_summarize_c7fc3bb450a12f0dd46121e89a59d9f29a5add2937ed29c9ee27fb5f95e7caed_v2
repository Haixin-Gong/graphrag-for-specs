It functions by intercepting lightning strikes and directing the electrical current safely to the ground, thereby minimizing damage to structures. These rods are often installed on elevated points such as rooftops, chimneys, or other high areas of buildings to maximize their effectiveness. Additionally, 接闪杆 may be interconnected with other rods via 接闪带 (lightning protection belts) to enhance overall safety and reliability.  \n\nIn summary, 接闪杆 serves as a critical component in lightning protection systems, primarily installed on or near buildings to attract, intercept, and safely channel lightning currents away from vulnerable structures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404844, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 175}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
