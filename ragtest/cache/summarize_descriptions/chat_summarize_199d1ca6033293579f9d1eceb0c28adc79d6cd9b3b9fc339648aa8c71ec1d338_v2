It establishes criteria based on two key parameters: the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) and the minimum ignition current ratio (MIC ratio). The standard provides a systematic approach to categorizing gases or vapors according to their safety-related properties, ensuring proper handling and mitigation of ignition risks in hazardous environments.
