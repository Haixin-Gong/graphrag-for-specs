These conductors ensure the effective dissipation of lightning energy into the ground, minimizing damage to structures. The system adheres to specific spacing requirements to optimize protection coverage. In Chinese, 引下线 is explicitly defined as the conductor within a lightning protection system responsible for directing lightning current into the grounding apparatus. Its primary function is to provide a low-resistance path for the current, thereby safeguarding buildings and infrastructure from the destructive effects of lightning strikes.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently emphasize its role as a down conductor, bridging the air-termination and grounding systems, with no contradictory information.
