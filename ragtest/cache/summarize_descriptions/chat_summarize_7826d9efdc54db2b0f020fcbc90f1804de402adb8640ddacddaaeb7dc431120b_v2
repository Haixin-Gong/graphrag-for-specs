It is designed to support the main furnace chamber and other associated components. The furnace base features a water-cooled structure to ensure stability and prevent deformation caused by exposure to high temperatures. Additionally, it is equipped with two electrodes and four O-ring seals, which enhance its functionality by maintaining structural integrity and preventing leaks or other operational issues. This combination of features makes the 炉底盘 a robust and essential element in the overall furnace system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742014802, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4_prod0225", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 290, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 107}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
