These buildings are characterized by a lower risk of significant destruction and personal injury compared to higher-risk structures, but they still require stricter protective measures than third-class buildings. Enhanced lightning protection measures are implemented to address the relatively higher risk level of these structures, ensuring greater safety and resilience. This classification balances the need for robust protection while acknowledging that the potential for severe damage or harm is not as extreme as in higher-risk categories.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404836, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 309, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 130}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
