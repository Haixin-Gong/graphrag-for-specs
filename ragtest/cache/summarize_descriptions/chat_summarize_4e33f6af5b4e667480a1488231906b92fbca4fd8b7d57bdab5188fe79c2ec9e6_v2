Unlike traditional systems that rely on hydraulic mechanisms, the 副炉室 employs a mechanical structure for these functions, which eliminates the need for a hydraulic system and significantly reduces the risk of oil contamination. This design is particularly optimized for magnetic field configurations, enhancing its efficiency and performance in specialized applications.\n\nAs part of the vacuum system, the 副炉室 is equipped with advanced features, including electric ball valves and vacuum measurement ports. It is connected to the auxiliary mechanical pump through a network of metal bellows, vertical pipes, and solenoid valves, ensuring a robust and reliable vacuum environment. Additionally, the chamber's lifting and external rotation mechanisms are driven by an electric push rod, which moves the lifting shaft to facilitate operations such as seed crystal installation and monocrystal removal. This mechanical transmission method ensures precise and controlled movements, further enhancing the chamber's functionality.\n\nIn summary, the 副炉室 combines mechanical innovation with advanced vacuum system integration, making it a versatile and efficient component of the MCZ-6000D furnace, particularly suited for tasks requiring precision and minimal contamination.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742014802, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4_prod0225", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 514, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 197}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
