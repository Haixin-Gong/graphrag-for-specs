It consists of several parts, including the furnace base, lower main chamber, upper main chamber, and furnace cover, all of which are assembled to form the main structure of the furnace. The chamber is constructed with water-cooled structures and is equipped with electrodes and observation windows, which facilitate temperature measurement and crystal diameter monitoring during operations.\n\nThe main furnace chamber is designed with a mechanical lifting and external rotation system, eliminating the need for a hydraulic system. This design reduces the risk of oil contamination and is optimized for magnetic field configurations. The lifting mechanism operates through a reducer that rotates a lifting screw, pushing the support arm to elevate the chamber to a certain height, after which it can be rotated externally. This mechanical structure enhances operational efficiency and reliability.\n\nIn addition to its mechanical and thermal functions, the main furnace chamber is an integral part of the vacuum system. It is equipped with safety valves, electric main ball valves, intelligent electric flow control valves, and leak detection interfaces. The chamber is connected to the main mechanical pump via metal bellows and solenoid valves, ensuring a stable and controlled vacuum environment.\n\nThe chamber has dimensions of φ850×1150mm, making it suitable for various crystal pulling applications. It is also used for thermal debugging during the crystal pulling process, ensuring optimal performance and precision in operations. Overall, the main furnace chamber is a versatile and essential component, combining mechanical, thermal, and vacuum functionalities to support advanced crystal growth processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742014802, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4_prod0225", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 322, "prompt_tokens": 364, "total_tokens": 686, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 300}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
