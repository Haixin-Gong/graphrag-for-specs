As part of the lower transmission assembly, it plays a key role in ensuring the alignment of the rotation centers between the crucible shaft and the seed crystal soft shaft, which is essential for precise operational control. Additionally, the crucible shaft is equipped with temperature measurement points to monitor the cooling water temperature, ensuring optimal thermal management during furnace operations. This combination of structural and functional features makes the 坩埚轴 integral to the efficient and accurate functioning of the furnace system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742014802, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4_prod0225", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 149}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
