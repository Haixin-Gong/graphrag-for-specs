It is typically installed in well-ventilated indoor or outdoor locations to ensure safety. The device is subject to specific regulations regarding the classification of hazardous areas, particularly concerning explosion risks. For instance, there are newly added examples of explosion hazard zone divisions that outline the safety requirements and boundaries for such installations. These guidelines ensure that the storage and handling of liquid hydrogen adhere to stringent safety standards to mitigate potential risks.  \n\nIn summary, the **液氢储存装置** serves as a critical infrastructure for liquid hydrogen storage, with clearly defined hazardous area classifications and safety measures to prevent explosions and other dangers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404861, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 104}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
