It is typically installed along building edges, rooftops, ridges, eaves, and other vulnerable areas prone to lightning strikes. The primary function of 接闪带 is to connect multiple **接闪杆** (lightning rods) to distribute the lightning current efficiently, reducing the load on individual down conductors. This component is a critical part of lightning protection systems, often employed on structures such as chimneys and other elevated building features to mitigate the risks associated with lightning strikes.  \n\nIn summary, 接闪带 serves as a protective measure by intercepting and redirecting lightning currents away from sensitive areas, ensuring the safety and structural integrity of buildings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404844, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 267, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 203}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
