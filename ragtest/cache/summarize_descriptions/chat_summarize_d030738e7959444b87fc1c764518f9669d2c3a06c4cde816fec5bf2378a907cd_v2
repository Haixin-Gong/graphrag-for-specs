It provides comprehensive regulations and guidelines for fire safety in various types of buildings, including clean production facilities and cleanroom environments. The standard covers a wide range of fire protection measures, such as:  \n\n- **Fire protection design requirements** for architectural layouts, including fire compartmentation standards.  \n- **Smoke exhaust facilities** and other fire safety measures in cleanrooms.  \n- **Fire protection power supply and distribution systems** for critical environments like cleanrooms.  \n- **Evacuation signage** and emergency safety measures.  \n- **Firefighting water supply and fire extinguishing equipment**, with both mandatory and recommended provisions.  \n\nGB50016 serves as a key reference for ensuring compliance with fire safety regulations in building construction and specialized facilities across China. The standard includes both **mandatory (强制性条文)** and **recommendatory (推荐性条文)** clauses, ensuring a balanced approach to fire risk management.  \n\n(Note: The descriptions provided are consistent, with minor variations in phrasing.
