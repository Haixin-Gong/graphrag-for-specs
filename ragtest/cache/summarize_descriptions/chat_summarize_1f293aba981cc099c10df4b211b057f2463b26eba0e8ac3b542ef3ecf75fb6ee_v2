The **引下线** serves to channel lightning current (雷电流) safely from the strike point to the **接地装置**, which then disperses the current into the ground. This process ensures that the lightning current is safely directed underground, minimizing damage to structures and equipment. Together, these components complete the lightning protection pathway, with the **引下线** acting as the conductive link and the **接地装置** providing the necessary dissipation into the earth.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently emphasize the role of the **引下线** in transferring lightning current to the **接地装置**, highlighting their interconnected function in safeguarding against lightning strikes.
