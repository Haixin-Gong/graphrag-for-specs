It is manufactured specifically for cable insulation, offering durability and cost-effectiveness. However, PVC is not recommended for use in high-temperature or low-temperature environments due to its limited thermal stability. Additionally, it is restricted in environmentally sensitive areas because of concerns regarding its low-toxicity properties, making it less suitable for applications requiring stringent environmental or health safety standards. Despite these limitations, PVC remains a common choice for general-purpose cable insulation where extreme conditions or strict environmental regulations are not a primary concern.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404851, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 120}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
