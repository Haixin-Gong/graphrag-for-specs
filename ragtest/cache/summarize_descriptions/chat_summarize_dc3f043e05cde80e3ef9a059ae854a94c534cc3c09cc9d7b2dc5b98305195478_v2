It consists of three primary components: **air-termination systems**, which capture the lightning strike; **down-conductor systems**, which channel the current downward; and **earth-termination systems**, which safely dissipate the energy into the ground.  \n\nFor optimal performance, the system's grounding should be integrated with other grounding systems and connected to metal pipelines to ensure **equipotential bonding**, minimizing potential differences and enhancing safety.
