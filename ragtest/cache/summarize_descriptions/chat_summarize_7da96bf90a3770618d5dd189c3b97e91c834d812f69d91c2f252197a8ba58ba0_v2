It is characterized by the separation of the neutral and protective earth conductors throughout the entire system, distinguishing it from other types of TN systems. This configuration ensures enhanced safety and reliability in power supply systems, particularly in sensitive environments such as data centers, where it is often mandated for AC-powered equipment. The TN-S system's design, with its distinct neutral and protective conductors, provides a robust grounding solution, minimizing the risk of electrical faults and improving overall system performance.  \n\nIn summary, the TN-S SYSTEM is a standardized earthing arrangement where the neutral and protective earth remain separate, making it a preferred choice for low-voltage power distribution, especially in critical applications like data centers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404848, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 171}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
