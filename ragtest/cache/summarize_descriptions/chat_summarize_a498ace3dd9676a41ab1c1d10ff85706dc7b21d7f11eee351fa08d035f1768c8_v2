The **BD** serves as a building-level distributor, connecting to the **CD**, which operates at the campus level, facilitating the routing and interconnection of backbone cables across multiple buildings in a campus environment. Together, they form a hierarchical framework for efficient cable distribution, ensuring seamless communication and connectivity within the infrastructure. Their roles are complementary, with the **BD** linking individual buildings to the broader campus network managed by the **CD**.
