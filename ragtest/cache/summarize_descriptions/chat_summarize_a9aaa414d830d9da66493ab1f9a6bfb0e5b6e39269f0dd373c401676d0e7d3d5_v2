While it offers durability and corrosion resistance, its inner surface is rougher compared to PVDF, which may impact water quality. Additionally, stainless steel pipes are specified for use in gas systems where gas purity is **≥99.99%** and the dew point is below **-60°C**, provided the inner wall is **bright polished** to minimize contamination risks.
