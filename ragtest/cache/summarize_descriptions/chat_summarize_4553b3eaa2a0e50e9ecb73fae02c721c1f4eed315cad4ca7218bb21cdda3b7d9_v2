The **建筑设计防火规范** (GB50016) establishes specific requirements for the design and construction of **洁净厂房**, ensuring fire safety measures are integrated into cleanroom facilities.  \n\nKey points include:  \n1. The fire protection design code outlines mandatory standards for **洁净厂房** construction to mitigate fire risks.  \n2. The **建筑设计防火规范** applies to cleanroom design, emphasizing safety protocols and compliance.  \n3. Electrical power supply and distribution systems for firefighting equipment in **洁净厂房** must adhere to the specifications set forth in **建筑设计防火规范** (GB50016).  \n\nIn summary, the **建筑设计防火规范** serves as a critical regulatory framework governing the fire safety aspects of **洁净厂房**, ensuring that design, construction, and operational practices meet stringent safety standards.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404917, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 374, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
