It employs spherical geometry by conceptually rolling a sphere of a specified radius over a structure to define lightning protection zones. This method is applicable to buildings of any height, though it is particularly referenced for structures exceeding 60 meters. The approach ensures a systematic and geometrically consistent way to assess protection coverage, making it a widely adopted standard in lightning protection engineering.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1748404847, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 100, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 151}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
