It connects the auxiliary chamber (副室) to the main furnace chamber (主炉室) and is also linked to the crystal lifting components. The 过渡室 features adjustable alignment mechanisms and vacuum sealing components, ensuring proper operation and environmental control. Additionally, it plays a key role in aligning the rotational centers of the seed crystal soft shaft and the crucible shaft, ensuring their coaxiality. This alignment is essential for the precise operation of the equipment, particularly in processes involving crystal growth or similar applications. Overall, the 过渡室 integrates structural connectivity, alignment adjustment, and vacuum sealing functionalities, making it a vital part of the system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742014802, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3a5770e1b4_prod0225", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 127}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
