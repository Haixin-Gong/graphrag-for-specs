It functions by intercepting lightning strikes and directing the electrical current safely to the ground, thereby minimizing damage to structures. These rods are often installed on elevated points such as rooftops, chimneys, or other high areas of buildings to maximize their effectiveness. Additionally, 接闪杆 may be interconnected with other rods via 接闪带 (lightning protection belts) to enhance overall safety and reliability.  \n\nIn summary, 接闪杆 serves as a critical component in lightning protection systems, primarily installed on or near buildings to attract, intercept, and safely channel lightning currents away from vulnerable structures.\",5\n588,滚球法,\"滚球法是一种用于确定接闪器保护范围的方法，通过模拟滚球在建筑物表面的滚动轨迹来确定防雷保护的有效区域。\"\"\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n411,接闪杆,接闪带,接闪杆 are connected by 接闪带 to improve雷电流 dispersion and reduce the load on individual引下线,15\n657,滚球法,接闪杆,滚球法用于确定接闪杆的保护范围，确保其有效覆盖需要保护的区域。,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
