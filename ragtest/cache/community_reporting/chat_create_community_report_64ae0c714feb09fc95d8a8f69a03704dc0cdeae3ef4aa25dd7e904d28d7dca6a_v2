Additionally, 接闪杆 may be interconnected with other rods via 接闪带 (lightning protection belts) to enhance overall safety and reliability.  \n\nIn summary, 接闪杆 serves as a critical component in lightning protection systems, primarily installed on or near buildings to attract, intercept, and safely channel lightning currents away from vulnerable structures.\",5\n447,接地装置,\"Grounding systems implemented using reinforced concrete structures\"\"\",8\n592,屋脊,,1\n589,屋檐,\"屋檐是建筑物屋顶的边缘部分，在防雷系统中是需要保护的易受雷击部位。\"\"\",1\n590,屋角,\"屋角是建筑物屋顶的转角部分，在防雷系统中是需要重点保护的易受雷击部位。\"\"\",1\n591,檐角,\"檐角是建筑物屋檐的转角部分，在防雷系统中是需要保护的易受雷击部位。\"\"\",1\n446,防雷引下线,\"A lightning protection system component using reinforced concrete structures\"\"\",1\n501,建筑物,,4\n588,滚球法,\"滚球法是一种用于确定接闪器保护范围的方法，通过模拟滚球在建筑物表面的滚动轨迹来确定防雷保护的有效区域。\"\"\",2\n548,热镀锌扁钢,\"Hot-dip galvanized flat steel, a material recommended for horizontal grounding electrodes in soil>\",2\n552,人工水平接地体,Artificial horizontal grounding electrode typically made of flat or round steel>,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n406,接闪带,接闪网,Both are components of lightning protection systems often used together on buildings,15\n411,接闪杆,接闪带,接闪杆 are connected by 接闪带 to improve雷电流 dispersion and reduce the load on individual引下线,15\n505,接闪网,接闪带,接闪网和接闪带都是防雷装置的一部分，共同用于保护建筑物免受雷击,15\n510,接地装置,钢筋混凝土屋面,钢筋混凝土屋面可以利用其内部的钢筋作为接地装置,11\n652,接闪带,屋脊,屋脊是需要安装接闪带进行防雷保护的关键部位。,11\n653,接闪带,屋檐,屋檐在特定条件下需要安装接闪带进行防雷保护。,11\n654,接闪带,屋角,屋角是需要重点安装接闪带进行防雷保护的部位。,11\n655,接闪带,檐角,檐角是需要安装接闪带进行防雷保护的部位。,11\n453,防雷引下线,接地装置,Both are components of lightning protection and grounding systems using reinforced concrete,9\n506,接闪网,建筑物,建筑物需要接闪网进行防雷保护,9\n657,滚球法,接闪杆,滚球法用于确定接闪杆的保护范围，确保其有效覆盖需要保护的区域。,7\n606,热镀锌扁钢,人工水平接地体,Hot-dip galvanized flat steel is used to make horizontal grounding electrodes,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
