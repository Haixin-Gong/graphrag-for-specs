It provides a low-resistance path to ensure electrical safety by directing excess or hazardous currents away from structures and equipment. The system typically consists of various types of electrodes (such as metal rods or plates) and conductors (including metal piping or dedicated grounding wires) to create an effective and reliable path for current dissipation. Its primary functions include protecting against electrical faults, minimizing the risk of electric shock, and safely channeling lightning energy into the ground.
