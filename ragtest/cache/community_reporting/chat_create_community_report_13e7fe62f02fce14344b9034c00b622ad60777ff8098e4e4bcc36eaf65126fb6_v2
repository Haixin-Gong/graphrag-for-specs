It is commonly used in manufacturing, industrial processes, and scientific research where sterile or particle-free conditions are essential.  \n\nKey features of a Clean Room include:  \n- **Regulated air quality**, with strict control over particulate concentration, temperature, humidity, and pressure.  \n- **Specialized sealing materials** to prevent contamination, particularly in industrial applications such as pipeline systems.  \n- **Stringent personnel procedures**, including air showers and purification protocols, to minimize human-introduced contaminants.  \n- **Air cleanliness standards**, ensuring compliance with industry-specific requirements for research or production.  \n\nClean Rooms are critical in industries like semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and aerospace, where even minor contamination can compromise product quality or experimental results. The level of control varies depending on the application, but all Clean Rooms prioritize maintaining a contaminant-free environment through advanced filtration and operational protocols.\",34\n1405,AIR SHOWER,\"The **AIR SHOWER** is a device or small room designed for use in cleanrooms to remove contaminants from personnel. It functions by blowing high-velocity, filtered air over individuals entering the cleanroom, effectively dislodging and removing particles from their clothing and body. This ensures that contaminants are minimized before personnel proceed further into the controlled environment.
